This programming project was completed by Kai Oxley and Ephraim Orisakiya, with most collaboration and discussion conducted via email.
Kai developed the core backend structure, including the base word class and the specialized 4-letter, 5-letter, and 6-letter word classes.
Ephraim contributed extensively to both the backend and front-end development.
He implemented and expanded backend logic, integrated additional functionality through the GUI-based front-end classes, and designed the overall user interface and functionality using fundamental GUI principles.
